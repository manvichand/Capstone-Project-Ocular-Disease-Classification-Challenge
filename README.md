# Capstone-Project-Ocular-Disease-Classification-Challenge
This project investigates the application of Deep Learning techniques i.e ResNet-50 to classify ocular diseases within color fundus images where the dataset provided by Peking University, consisting 5,000 structured desensitized ophthalmologic image set of patient's age, sex, binocular color fundus photos and doctors' diagnostic keywords was used. This dataset comes from patients who are taken ocular health examinationin cooperative hospitals and medical institutions.This project effectively categorize ocular diseases into eight distinctive classes: normal, diabetes, glaucoma, cataract, AMD, hypertension, myopia, and other abnormalities.
